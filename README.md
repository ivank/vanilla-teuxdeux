# Vanilla TeuxDeux

A case study if its possible to implement a modern-y javascript single page application, with only vanilla web technologies.

## Reason

Just trying to see if its actually possible to have a maintainable single page application, without pulling the whole earth worth of npm dependencies. In fact, a challange for this particular case study is ... no dependencies.

## Approach

- No images, just unicode icons.
- No custom fonts, only web safe fonts.
- No external JS or CSS dependencies.
